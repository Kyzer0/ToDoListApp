[Project Name] API
Overview
The [Project Name] API is a RESTful web service built with ASP.NET Core to [briefly describe purpose, e.g., manage tasks, track expenses, or fetch weather data]. This project demonstrates my skills in developing modern .NET APIs, including CRUD operations, database integration with Entity Framework Core, and API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI. It is designed to be simple, scalable, and easy to set up.
Features

CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete [resources, e.g., tasks, books, expenses].
Database Integration: Uses Entity Framework Core with [database, e.g., SQLite, SQL Server] for data persistence.
API Documentation: Interactive Swagger UI for testing endpoints.
[Optional Feature, e.g., Authentication]: Supports user authentication using [e.g., ASP.NET Core Identity, JWT].
[Optional Feature, e.g., Filtering]: Filter [resources] by [e.g., status, category, date].
[Optional Feature, e.g., Caching]: Implements caching to optimize performance.

Technologies Used

.NET: [Version, e.g., .NET 8]
ASP.NET Core: For building the RESTful API
Entity Framework Core: For database operations
Swagger/OpenAPI: For API documentation
[Optional, e.g., xUnit]: For unit testing
[Optional, e.g., SQLite/SQL Server]: As the database
[Optional, e.g., HttpClient]: For integrating with external APIs

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

.NET SDK [Version, e.g., 8.0]
[Database, e.g., SQLite, SQL Server Express] (if applicable)
[Optional, e.g., Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code]
[Optional, e.g., Postman] for testing API endpoints

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/[RepositoryName].git
cd [RepositoryName]


Restore Dependencies:
dotnet restore


Configure the Database (if applicable):

Update the connection string in appsettings.json:
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "[YourConnectionString, e.g., Data Source=[ProjectName].db]"
}


Run migrations to set up the database:
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update




Run the Application:
dotnet run

The API will be available at https://localhost:[Port]/ (e.g., https://localhost:7077).

Access Swagger UI:

Open your browser and navigate to https://localhost:[Port]/swagger to explore and test the API endpoints.
